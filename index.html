        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am currently working toward an exciting career change! After spending over a decade working with my hands to fix broken things, I am now pursuing a path that will allow me to build things from scratch using my brain, my imagination, and my creativity.</p>
        <p>I have spent almost fifteen years travelling the world and working as a Jet Engine Mechanic. Those fifteen years were intermingled with brief spurts of mini-retirements on my family farm (where I milked a lot of goats). Neither of those skill sets have anything to do, at all, with web development. Just being honest.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am working toward proficiency in the following skill sets:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, I would rather win the lottery, but if for some reason that strategy doesn't pan out, then I intend to work for a living. And if I have to work for a living I might as well love what I do. For that reason I am dedicating whatever spare time I have left after busy days spent scratching lottery tickets to gaining sellable skills in the world of technology.</p>
